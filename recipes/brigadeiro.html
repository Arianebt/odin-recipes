        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Condensed milk: Use sweetened condensed milk for best results.</li>
            <li>Butter: Salted or unsalted.</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder: A good quality one makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>Sprinkles: Any kind, or just omit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the condensed milk, butter, and sifted cocoa powder in a pan set over a low heat.</li>
            <li>Mix well with a spatula to get a smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Continue to stir until it thickens, which might take up to 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>You know the paste is cooked well when it coats the back of the spatula and you can see the bottom of the pan for at least 3-4 seconds when you drag the spatula through it.</li>
            <li>Remove it from the heat, and leave to cool completely.</li>
            <li>You can then shape it into balls, then coat with sprinkles or desiccated coconut.</li>
        </ol>
